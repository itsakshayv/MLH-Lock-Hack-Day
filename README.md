# MLH-Lock-Hack-Day
Everyone is welcome to participate in Local Hack Day regardless of experience level, student status, or age. Each day there will be challenges geared towards beginners, so even if you’ve never coded before, there’s something here for you.
Local Hack Day is organized by Major League Hacking (MLH). MLH is the official global hacker community.
Local Hack Day: Build will run from Sunday, January 10th to Monday, January 18th. During this time, you can expect challenges for all skill levels. These challenges can be completed on your own time, and new ones will be released each day via email. Once the daily challenges are announced, you’ll have 24 hours to complete and submit them in order to earn those points on the leaderboard.  
‍
If the daily challenges aren’t quite your speed, there will also be plenty of week-long challenges you can complete at any time. These will range from quick technical challenges to tasks you can complete with your guildmates, both beginner friendly and technically advanced so there is something for everyone. You can learn more about these below!
